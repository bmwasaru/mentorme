Dear _____________,

My name is Last Name, and I got you contact from the Mentor001.

Thank you for participating as a mentor of the Mentor001 program, I am very fortunate to have you as a mentor match! I heard about the program through a friend of mine and it seems like a great program that will help me explore my career goals. 

I am a junior majoring in chemistry. Outside of classes I volunteer with the Chemistry club/ church/ etc. I am also involved student association/etc. I enjoy spending my free time at the beach or with friends.

I look forward to participating in the program and hear your suggestions of how I can best prepare for the professional world while at the campus. I am interested in hearing more about what you do at Base Titunium as a chemist.

I look forward to hearing from you to arrange a time to talk. My contact information is (###) ###-#### and student@university.edu.

Thank you again for you time!

Sincerely,

First and Last Name.
